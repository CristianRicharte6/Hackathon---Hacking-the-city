# Hackathon - Hacking-the-city
## Social, Cultural and Economic Hackathon in Barcelona

Hidden Art is a website platform to help local Artists to live under better conditions. This platform helps them to be more accessible and reach more people. Through Hidden Art, the users/clients can book public or exclusive experience with their favourite artist, or even an artist they just met minutes ago...

3% of the total revenue is stored monthly in a Smart contract, and it will be used to invest in the 5 most voted Artists from the platform. This Smart contract can only be unlocked once a year period has passed and once all the funds have been withdrawn. It will set another year period to receive funds and to unlock.
