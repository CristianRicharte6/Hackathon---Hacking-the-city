## Social, Cultural and Economic Hackathon in Barcelona

<strong>Hidden Art is a DApp created to help urban Artists to live under better conditions.</strong> This platform helps them to be more accessible and reach more people. Through Hidden Art, the users/clients can book public or exclusive experience (Workshops, a whole day with the artist, a coffe/beer time, etc) with their favourite artist, or even an artist they just met minutes ago...

3% of the total revenue is stored monthly in a Smart contract, and it will be used to invest in the 5 most voted Artists from the platform. This Smart contract can only be unlocked once a year period has passed and once all the funds have been withdrawn, the smart contract will set another year period to receive funds and to unlock.

## Frontend

HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
React
Vite
We used as a build tool Vite because of its fast configuration and also because creating a development environment from the ground up allows to realize what dependencies and scripts the project will really require.

## NFTs & Smart contracts

Solidity
Hardhat
IPFS
Infura
Although due time constraints, we did not create a full blockchain DApp we managed to create the Smart Contracts and be able to visualize the NFT's metadata.
